# Estimate a basic dynamic discrete choice model
This project solves a single-agent dynamic discrete choice model using the nested fixed point algorithm using [Julia v1.5.3](https://julialang.org/). The data simulation part is built on the [Matlab code](https://github.com/jabbring/dynamic-discrete-choice) by Jaap Abbring and Tobias Klein. The theoretical notes are borrowed from the excellent [notes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r28pxyckyqdbgwv/Structural_Methods_IO_QM_upload.pdf?dl=0) by Ali Hortacsu and Joonhwi Joo.
